This program is intended for Vatsim VRC Sector files for each ARTCC. 
It will go through the sector file for the ARTCC and create individual txt files
for each section of the sector file. Once its complete you can change out a 
specific section (text file) with what you need. Then you can recompile it back
into one .sct2 file. This program will create the files inside a folder located
where the program EXE is located called "Sector_Files".

Please post any issues you come across on GitHub under the Issues tab and I will
try to correct them as they come in. 

*******************************
Requirements:
	Sector File must be located where the program EXE file is located.
	Sector File Must be named "SECTOR.SCT2"
	EXE must be located where it does not need ADMIN permissions to create files.
